/// The base type that all other Quest types inherit from.
///
/// This class simply contains the bare minimum set of functions required to make Quest work.
///
/// Since everything inherits from it, you probably shouldn't edit it directly. If you want to make 
/// attributes that are globally visible, you should probably do that within [`Kernel`](
/// crate::types::Kernel) instead.
///
/// # Additional Attributes
/// 
/// In addition to those detailed in this class, there are two additional keys that are always
/// defined: `__id__` and `__parents__`.
///
/// ## `__id__`
///
/// `__id__` is an unique identifier for each object and cannot be changed. (You _can_ assign to
/// `__id__`, but if you ever try to read it, you'll end up with the object's original id.) This is
/// used in multiple places, including the default `inspect` and `==` implementations.
///
/// ## `__parents__`
///
/// The meat of Quest, `__parents__` is how dynamic attribute lookup happens. When fetching an
/// attribute, the following places are looked, in order: (Note that this only applies to 
/// fetching attributes; setting and deleting attributes only work on the base object.)
///
/// 1. Builtin attributes (i.e. `__id__`, `__parents__`). Additionally, there are two "special"
/// attributes that aren't considered to be a part of any particular object: `__this__` and
/// `__stack__`
///    - `__stack__` returns a list of all the stackframes so far, with `0` being the current one.
///    - `__this__` is the same as `__stack__.$get(0)`. Currently, it's only defined for scopes, but
///      this may be changed in the future.
/// 2. Any attributes directly defined for the object. (e.g. `foo.$bar = 3;`).
/// 3. If `__attr_missing__` is defined, it is called; if a non-[`Null`] response is given, then
///    that value is returned. (In the future there may be a way to mark `null` as a valid response,
///    possibly with something like the `undefined` of javascript?)
/// 4. Each parent, in order, is asked if they (Or any of their parents) have the attribute.
///    the first parental chain that has one is returned.
/// 5. If nothing succeeds, (either an error or [`Null`] is returned. I haven't figured out which
///    is the best yet.)
///
/// [`Null`]: crate::types::Null;
///
/// ## `:#`
/// 
/// Stack frame literal references have bene added to Quest: `:#` is identical to
/// `__stack__.$get(#)`, but allows for shorter mannerisms such as `return(:1)`.

	/// This differs from `@text` by their goals: `@text` is used to convert to a [`Text`] object,
	/// whereas `inspect` is used to get a debugging representation.
	///
	/// # Quest Examples
	/// ```quest
	/// assert(  == 1.$inspect() == "1" );
	/// assert(  == 2.$inspect() == '"2"' );

	///
